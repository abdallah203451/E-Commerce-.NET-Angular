# üõí Full-Stack E-Commerce Website

This project is a fully functional, feature-rich e-commerce platform built using **.NET 8 Web API** for the backend and **Angular 17** for the frontend. The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and includes robust authentication, role-based authorization, payment integration, and various product management features.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project uses **Clean Architecture** which is divided into the following layers:

- **Application Layer**: Handles business logic, service contracts, and use cases.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core domain entities and business rules.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements external services like databases, repositories, email, and caching.
- **Presentation Layer**: Exposes the Web API endpoints for client interaction.

Additionally, I used the **Repository Pattern** to maintain separation of concerns, ensure testability, and promote scalability.

## üöÄ Features

### Backend:

- **JWT Authentication & Refresh Tokens**: The application uses **JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions. Both access and refresh tokens are implemented to ensure secure and long-lasting sessions.
- **Role-Based Authentication & Authorization**: Supports different roles (e.g., User, Seller) with distinct permissions. Roles such as **User** and **Seller** have distinct permissions within the app, ensuring that users only have access to functionalities relevant to their role.
- **Payment Integration (PayPal)**: Payments are processed through **PayPal**, tested using developer accounts for security and reliability.
- **Email Sending (SendGrid)**: Email functionality is powered by **SendGrid**, allowing the system to send emails for password recovery and other essential communication.
- **Trending Products Caching**: Improved performance by caching frequently accessed product data, reducing redundant database queries.
- **Efficient Product Pagination**: Supports large datasets by retrieving products in paginated form, reducing load times and improving scalability.
- **Product Filtering**: Allows users to easily search for products by various criteria, improving the overall shopping experience.
- **Profile Management**: Both users and sellers can update profile information and change passwords.
- **Seller Product Management**: Sellers can add, update, and delete products.
- **User Payment History**: Users can view their order payment history.
- **AutoMapper**: Simplifies object mapping between entities and DTOs, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability and maintainability.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: Efficient and secure data transfer between frontend and backend.

### Frontend:

- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive layout built using **Bootstrap**.
- **JWT Interceptor**: Automatically attaches JWT tokens to API requests for authenticated endpoints.
- **Route Guards**: Protects sensitive routes from unauthorized access.
- **ngx-toastr**: Provides user-friendly success and error notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
